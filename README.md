## Detecting bacteria in blood from images

#### using MATLAB

![Example of program](https://github.com/douglascarrie/Detecting-Bacteria-in-Blood-with-Image-Processing/blob/master/output/example.png)

This project aimed to create code which could seperate bacteria from red blood cells 
within an image. The red blood cells are formed as rough circular shapes and the bacteira can be
anything from faint lines to small dots.

Various image processing methods through MATLAB were used within this project:

- Greyscalling images
- Rescaling images
- Creating histograms of the image before enhancement
- Contrast adjustment
- Image binarization
- Edge detection (Canny, Prewitt, Sobel)
- Image padding
- Image noise removal
- Object extraction by size

##### Challenges faced in this project: 
- Seperating Red blood cells from bacteria where they are connected in the image.
- Detecting Red blood cells of unique shapes
